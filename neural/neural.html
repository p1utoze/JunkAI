    <h1>NEURAL NETWORK</h1>
    <P>At the end we have made it our mission to expand our ideas to a next level were the entire society with no discrimination gets to enjoy our service  and contributes in making the world a better place we are designing a  artificially intelligent network which can analyze the data giver  and help us improve our waste management game by making it interactive and fun we would have a personal assistant software for every hose hold that would have algorithm that would help and give them ideas in how to manage their waste and make it competitive by compareing them with their friends and making it fun
        In this stage we will widely distribute the algorithm over a huge area that makes the management of data more easy and improves waste management affecting our life
