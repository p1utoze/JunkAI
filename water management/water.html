    <h1>WASTE MANAGEMENT OF WATER</h1>
    <P>We have come to a stage where we are facing difficulty in 
        finding pure water to drink we hv polluted the water table 
        and hence are being deprived of proper drinking water and as
        growing demand is at a study grow we are also have a hard time
        cleaning our used water as we lack the infrastructure to do so
        Our project also deals with this issue by providing solutions on
        a smaller unit scale that reduces stress on industrial water 
        purification systems hence solve the infrastructure drawbacks
        we face and we intend to purify daily used water by installing
        micro computer governed smart systems that test the water for 
        impurities and adds hardness or purifiers accordingly</P>

            <h3>How AI can help in waste management?</h3>
            <p>
            AI can be used to reduce pollutants in the water which in turn decreases 
            water contamination and scarcity of clean water. AI can be leveraged to 
            detect the amount and composition of toxic contaminants since AI works on 
            optics, which can increase the efficiency of waste management systems.

            <h3>How does AI help in controlling the water quality?</h3>
            <p>
            Clean Water AI is an IoT device that classifies and detects dangerous 
            bacteria and harmful particles. The system can run continuously in real
            time. The cities can install IoT devices across different water sources
            and they will be able to monitor water quality as well as contamination 
            continuously.

            <h3>What does digital water mean?</h3>
            <p>
            Digital Water uses real-time data to provide recommendations to users â€” actionable
            intelligence that can bridge the gap between our inherent need for clean water and
            the practical reality of working across an ever-failing national infrastructure.
